How to upload a file in selenium without sendKeys() function?

-> 2 solutions:

>>> We can copy the path of file in clipboard in java.
    Using Robot class, press ctrl+V for sending the path of file to be uploaded

>>> We can use Autoit tool for developing a script and compiling it
    Autoit tool detects the image upload request window
    Then, using Java, we can execute that script(using Runtime) when the upload image pop-up window occurs
